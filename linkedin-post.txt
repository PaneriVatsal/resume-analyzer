I built an AI tool that ranks 100 resumes in under 2 minutes.

No ATS. No expensive SaaS. Just open source.

Here's the problem:
→ Hiring managers spend 7 seconds per resume
→ Great candidates get lost in the pile
→ Manual screening doesn't scale

So I built AI Resume Vibe Check 🤖

Paste a job description. Upload resumes. Get a ranked list — instantly.

Here's what it does:
📄 Accepts multiple resumes (PDF/Doc) in one batch
🎯 Matches each candidate against your JD using Google Gemini AI
📊 Generates a "Vibe Score" — a match percentage for every candidate
🏷️ Auto-tags candidates as Interview, Review, or Reject
📅 Suggests interview dates for top matches

The architecture:
⚡ Next.js 16 + React 19 frontend
🔄 n8n workflow automation for AI orchestration
🧠 Google Gemini for intelligent resume parsing
🎨 Dark glassmorphism UI that actually looks good

The best part? It's completely open source.
